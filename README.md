# CloudEnv CLI

Welcome, here's how easy it is to get started with CloudEnv...

```console
foo@bar:~$ cloudenv login
foo@bar:~$ cd /var/apps/sampleapp
foo@bar:~$ cloudenv init              # this creates your secret 64-bit key
foo@bar:~$ cloudenv merge .env        # this merges your existing env keys into CloudEnv
```
